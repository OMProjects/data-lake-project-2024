The judge called the children's deaths an \"unimaginable loss,'' but he noted Grossman's lack of any criminal record and history of philanthropic activity. While conceding that the defendant engaged in \"incredibly selfish behavior'' after the crash, the judge added, \"she's not a monster as the prosecution attempts to portray her.''\n\nGrossman, who will turn 61 on Friday, was convicted Feb. 23 of two counts each of second-degree murder and vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence and one count of hit-and-run driving for the Sept. 29, 2020, deaths of Mark and Jacob Iskander, aged 11 and 8. The judge ordered her to be taken into custody minutes after the jury's verdict, rejecting a request by one of her trial attorneys to allow her to remain free on $2 million bond while awaiting sentencing.\n\nTears flowed throughout the hours-long sentencing hearing that stretched into early Monday afternoon. Grossman could be seen crying as people spoke during the hearing.\n\nTo this day I cannot kiss my kids good night because I think about what happened... She had many opportunities to have mercy on me. She knew she killed the boys in front of their brother. She wanted to take the trial to the very end.\n\nNancy Iskander, mother\n\nWhen it was her turn to speak, Grossman turned toward the courtroom audience -- containing the boys' family -- and again fought through tears, saying she wanted the family to know \"how sorry I am.''\n\nShe insisted that she was unable to reach out to the boys' family as the case was pending on the advice of her attorneys, who told her it would amount to \"tampering with witnesses.''\n\n\"I'm so sorry I wasn't able to reach out to you,'' Grossman said.\n\nShe also insisted that she never saw the boys in the street the night of the crash.\n\n\"God knows that I never saw anybody,'' she said. \"I never saw anyone. I believe he knows the truth.''\n\nShe added that she would have \"driven into a brick wall'' rather than strike two children. She said the boys' deaths are something she will carry with her \"until my dying breath.''\n\nI've waited four years to say I'm sorry to you... I would have wanted God to take my life that night. If I could just bring Mark and Jacob back, I would give my life.\n\nRebecca Grossman\n\nThe boys' mother, Nancy Iskander, said during the hearing that she disputes Grossman's contention that she was advised by her attorneys not to try to speak to the victims' parents.\n\nShe also said she saw Grossman outside the hospital emergency room that night.\n\n\"She looked me in the eye!\" Iskander said, her voice rising. \"You looked me in the eye. You knew they were dying.''\n\nProsecutors said the boys were crossing the street with their family in a marked crosswalk when they were struck by Grossman's vehicle. Deputy District Attorney Ryan Gould told jurors in his closing argument that debris from the crash matched Grossman's vehicle and there was \"not a shred'' of evidence that Grossman's then-boyfriend -- former Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Scott Erickson -- struck the children first with his black Mercedes-Benz SUV just ahead of Grossman's vehicle, as defense attorneys contended during the trial.\n\nIn a typed letter to the judge prior to Monday's hearing, Grossman wrote, \"... I am not a murderer, and I ask you to recognize that true fact. My pain, my recognition of the pain the Iskanders suffer, and the pain I watch my family endure, are punishments that I already suffer and will for the rest of my life. Please consider this suffering when you consider what more punishment to impose on me in this case.''\n\nGrossman wrote that she penned a letter and left roses at the scene of the crash, and has \"relived the life-shattering split second of the accident over and over in my head a million times.'' But she maintained that she was \"not driving under the influence of alcohol or impaired, and I was not racing.''\n\n\"... From the very beginning, the facts have been distorted and misrepresented, turning the tragic accident into murder and me into a cold-blooded killer,'' she added. \"The voices demanding vengeance and retribution are reacting to the tragic loss of Mark and Jacob, but they do not fairly describe me or who I am.

While conceding that the defendant engaged in &quot;incredibly selfish behavior&#39;&#39; after the crash, the judge added, &quot;she&#39;s not a monster as the prosecution attempts to portray her.&#39;&#39;</p>\n\n<p>Grossman, who will turn 61 on Friday, was convicted Feb. 23 of two counts each of second-degree murder and vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence and one count of hit-and-run driving for the Sept. 29, 2020, deaths of Mark and Jacob Iskander, aged 11 and 8. The judge ordered her to be taken into custody minutes after the jury&#39;s verdict, rejecting a request by one of her trial attorneys to allow her to remain free on $2 million bond while awaiting sentencing.</p>\n\n<p>Tears flowed throughout the hours-long sentencing hearing that stretched into early Monday afternoon. Grossman could be seen crying as people spoke during the hearing.</p>\n\n<p>To this day I cannot kiss my kids good night because I think about what happened... She had many opportunities to have mercy on me. She knew she killed the boys in front of their brother. She wanted to take the trial to the very end.</p>\n\n<p>Nancy Iskander, mother</p>\n\n<p>When it was her turn to speak, Grossman turned toward the courtroom audience -- containing the boys&#39; family -- and again fought through tears, saying she wanted the family to know &quot;how sorry I am.&#39;&#39;</p>\n\n<p>She insisted that she was unable to reach out to the boys&#39; family as the case was pending on the advice of her attorneys, who told her it would amount to &quot;tampering with witnesses.&#39;&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m so sorry I wasn&#39;t able to reach out to you,&#39;&#39; Grossman said.</p>\n\n<p>She also insisted that she never saw the boys in the street the night of the crash.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;God knows that I never saw anybody,&#39;&#39; she said. &quot;I never saw anyone. I believe he knows the truth.&#39;&#39;</p>\n\n<p>She added that she would have &quot;driven into a brick wall&#39;&#39; rather than strike two children. She said the boys&#39; deaths are something she will carry with her &quot;until my dying breath.&#39;&#39;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve waited four years to say I&#39;m sorry to you... I would have wanted God to take my life that night. If I could just bring Mark and Jacob back, I would give my life.</p>\n\n<p>Rebecca Grossman</p>\n\n<p>The boys&#39; mother, Nancy Iskander, said during the hearing that she disputes Grossman&#39;s contention that she was advised by her attorneys not to try to speak to the victims&#39; parents.</p>\n\n<p>She also said she saw Grossman outside the hospital emergency room that night.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;She looked me in the eye!&quot; Iskander said, her voice rising. &quot;You looked me in the eye. You knew they were dying.&#39;&#39;</p>\n\n<p>Prosecutors said the boys were crossing the street with their family in a marked crosswalk when they were struck by Grossman&#39;s vehicle. Deputy District Attorney Ryan Gould told jurors in his closing argument that debris from the crash matched Grossman&#39;s vehicle and there was &quot;not a shred&#39;&#39; of evidence that Grossman&#39;s then-boyfriend -- former Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Scott Erickson -- struck the children first with his black Mercedes-Benz SUV just ahead of Grossman&#39;s vehicle, as defense attorneys contended during the trial.</p>\n\n<p>In a typed letter to the judge prior to Monday&#39;s hearing, Grossman wrote, &quot;... I am not a murderer, and I ask you to recognize that true fact. My pain, my recognition of the pain the Iskanders suffer, and the pain I watch my family endure, are punishments that I already suffer and will for the rest of my life. Please consider this suffering when you consider what more punishment to impose on me in this case.&#39;&#39;</p>\n\n<p>Grossman wrote that she penned a letter and left roses at the scene of the crash, and has &quot;relived the life-shattering split second of the accident over and over in my head a million times.&#39;&#39; But she maintained that she was &quot;not driving under the influence of alcohol or impaired, and I was not racing.&#39;&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;... From the very beginning, the facts have been distorted and misrepresented, turning the tragic accident into murder and me into a cold-blooded killer,&#39;&#39; she added. &quot;The voices demanding vengeance and retribution are reacting to the tragic loss of Mark and Jacob, but they do not fairly describe me or who I am. I am not a murderer.&#39;&#39;</p>\n\n<p>Prosecutors &#39;disappointed&#39; with judge&#39;s sentence after requesting 34 years to life</p>\n\n<p>In their sentencing memorandum, Deputy District Attorneys Ryan Gould, Jamie Castro and Habib Balian wrote that the defendant&#39;s actions since the night of the crash &quot;show a complete lack of remorse and narcissistic superiority that leads to only one conclusion, that she is undeserving of any leniency.&#39;&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The defendant has never shown an ounce of remorse for her choices on September 29, 2020.
